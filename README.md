## 🎯 Project Overview

LabCare is a modern, responsive web application designed to streamline the lab test booking process. The system allows users to book lab tests online, view reports, manage appointments, and provide feedback. This project was developed as part of the Software Process Modeling course assignment, demonstrating the application of modern web development practices and React.js framework.

### Problem Statement

- Online test booking with home sample collection options
- Real-time report access
- Appointment management
- User feedback collection

2. **Accessibility**: Enable users to book tests and access reports from anywhere
3. **Efficiency**: Streamline the booking process with automated scheduling
